## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I practiced using Flexbox and Media Queries. I got to learn a good bit about making a website responsive with Media Queries. Flexbox helped me align all my elements to get the desired layout.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This helped me with any CSS styling questions that arose throughtout the creation process. I got to get a better understanding of Flexbox and Media Queries with Mozilla's resources.
